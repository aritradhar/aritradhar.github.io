However, as current LLMs are vulnerable to leaking sensitive information, it has proven difficult to apply them in settings where strict access control is necessary. To this end, we design AC-LoRA, an end-to-end system for access control-aware corporate LLM chatbots that maintains a strong information isolation guarantee. AC-LoRA maintains separate LoRA adapters for permissioned datasets, along with the document embedding they are finetuned on. AC-LoRA retrieves a precise set of LoRA adapters based on the similarity score with the user query and their permission. This similarity score is later used to merge the responses if more than one LoRA is retrieved, without requiring any additional training for LoRA routing. We provide an end-to-end prototype of AC-LoRA, evaluate it on two datasets, and show that AC-LoRA matches or even exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art LoRA mixing techniques while providing strong isolation guarantees. Furthermore, we show that AC-LoRA design can be directly applied to different modalities.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">S&amp;P 2025</abbr> </div> <div id="dhar2025guardain" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">GuardAIn: Protecting Emerging Generative AI Workloads on Heterogeneous NPU</div> <div class="author"> Aritra Dhar, Clement Thorens, Lara Magdalena Lazier, and Lukas Cavigelli </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> 2025 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2025/223600d823/26hiVLrJZi8" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="https://www.computer.org/csdl/pds/api/csdl/proceedings/download-article/26hiVLrJZi8/pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Driven by recent advances in large language models (LLM), generative AI applications have become the dominant workload for the modern cloud.

In this paper, we investigate the fundamental design principles for enabling hardware-backed isolated and attestable instances, a.k.a., enclaves that provide isolation of code and data from attacker-controlled host software stack (OS/VMM). We prototype custom TEE hardware support for two kinds of accelerators: NPU and SSD with low overhead, that show the feasibility of adding TEE support to existing accelerators.

From a security standpoint, cloud customers want to protect their data. They are willing to pay additional costs for trusted execution environments such as enclaves provided by Intel SGX and AMD SEV. Unfortunately, the customers have to make a critical choice—either use domain-specific accelerators for speed or use CPU-based confidential computing solutions. To bridge this gap, we aim to enable data-center scale confidential computing that expands across CPUs and accelerators. We argue that having wide-scale TEE support for accelerators presents a technically easier solution, but is far away from being a reality. Instead, our hybrid design provides enclaved execution guarantees for computation distributed over multiple CPU nodes and devices with/without TEE support. Our solution scales gracefully in two dimensions—it can handle a large number of heterogeneous nodes and it can accommodate TEE-enabled devices as and when they are available in the future. We observe marginal overheads of 0.42% - 8% on real-world AI data center workloads that are independent of the number of nodes in the data center. We add custom TEE support to two accelerators (AI and storage) and integrate it into our solution, thus demonstrating that it can cater to future TEE devices.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">CHES 2022</abbr> </div> <div id="schneider2021pie" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Composite Enclaves: Towards Disaggregated Trusted Execution</div> <div class="author"> Moritz Schneider, Aritra Dhar, Ivan Puddu, Kari Kostiainen, and Srdjan Capkun </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>CHES 2022</em>, 2022 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/9309" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/article/view/9309/8875" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The ever-rising computation demand is forcing the move from the CPU to heterogeneous specialized hardware, which is readily available across modern datacenters through disaggregated infrastructure. On the other hand, trusted execution environments (TEEs), one of the most promising recent developments in hardware security, can only protect code confined in the CPU, limiting TEEs’ potential and applicability to a handful of applications. We observe that the TEEs’ hardware trusted computing base (TCB) is fixed at design time, which in practice leads to using untrusted software to employ peripherals in TEEs. Based on this observation, we propose composite enclaves with a configurable hardware and software TCB, allowing enclaves access to multiple computing and IO resources. Finally, we present two case studies of composite enclaves: i) an FPGA platform based on RISC-V Keystone connected to emulated peripherals and sensors, and ii) a large-scale accelerator. These case studies showcase a flexible but small TCB (2.5 KLoC for IO peripherals and drivers), with a low-performance overhead (only around 220 additional cycles for a context switch), thus demonstrating the feasibility of our approach and showing that it can work with a wide range of specialized hardware.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">Thesis 2021</abbr> </div> <div id="dhar2021building" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Building Trust in Modern Computing Platforms</div> <div class="author"> Aritra Dhar </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>ETH Zurich</em>, 2021 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/487786" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/bitstream/handle/20.500.11850/487786/thesis_w_cover.pdf?sequence=2&amp;isAllowed=y" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>User interfaces (UI) are essential parts of modern complex computing platforms as it dictates how humans provide inputs to these systems and interpret output from them. Many remote safety and security-critical cyber-physical systems such as industrial PLCs (in manufacturing, power plants, etc.), medical implants are accessible through rich UIs over browsers or dedicated applications that are running on commodity systems or hosts. Similarly, e-banking, e-voting, social networks, and many other remote applications and services are critically dependent on UIs for user authentication and IO. An attacker-controlled host can not only observe user’s IO data but also can modify them undetected. Loss of integrity and confidentiality of user inputs can lead to catastrophic failure of critical infrastructures, loss of human lives, leakage of sensitive data. The problem of secure communication between a user and an end-system is known as trusted path. Such attacks are not far-fetched as modern software and hardware systems are incredibly complex and span over millions of lines of code. Hence the users are bound to trust a massive trusted computing base or TCB. Exploiting software vulnerabilities of the OS, hypervisors, database systems are very prevalent. Recent technologies such as Trusted execution environments (TEEs) address this problem by reducing the TCB by running isolated environments on the CPU cores, known as enclaves, that are isolated from the OS or hypervisor. However, TEEs do not solve the trusted path problem as TEEs depend on the OS to communicate to the external IO devices. Moreover, the remote attestation mechanism by which a verifier can ensure that she is communicating with the proper enclave is vulnerable to relay attack. In the context of disaggregated computing architecture in modern data centers, the security properties of traditional TEE are insufficient as the trusted path application involves sensitive data not only on the CPU cores but also on the specialized external hardware like accelerators. </p> <p></p> In this thesis, we propose mechanisms to build trust in modern computing platforms by addressing the trusted path problem, and we make the following contributions. First, we analyze existing trusted path systems and found several attacks that compromise user IO data integrity and confidentiality. We are the first to analyze the trusted path problem to find a set of essential security properties and implement them in a system named ProtectIOn using a trusted embedded device as an intermediary. This trusted device intercepts all IO data and overlays secure UI on the display signal. Next, we look into Intel SGX and investigate how one can integrate a trusted path solution to TEEs. We notice that the relay attack on the SGX remote attestation can be detrimental to the trusted path security properties. We design ProximiTEE, a system that uses distance bounding to verify physical proximity to an SGX processor. We also show how the distance bounding mechanism can be used in a high frequency to allocate or revoke platforms in data centers without relying on an online PKI. Finally, we look into the disaggregated computing model of the modern data centers where the TEEs are insufficient as the computation is no longer limited to the CPU cores but several external devices such as GPUs, accelerators, etc. We propose our system PIE based on RISC-V architecture that combines the enclaves running on the CPU and firmware external hardware to a single attestable domain that we call platform-wide enclaves. Inside these platform-wide enclaves, individual binaries (enclaves and firmware) can be remotely attested. </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge rounded w-100">S&amp;P Mag 2020</abbr> </div> <div id="10.1109/MSEC.2020.2990230" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Dedicated Security Chips in the Age of Secure Enclaves</div> <div class="author"> Kari Kostiainen, Aritra Dhar, and Srdjan Capkun </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>IEEE Security and Privacy</em>, Sep 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/MSEC.2020.2990230" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOI</a> <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MSEC.2020.2990230" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">HTML</a> <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9095263" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PDF</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Secure enclave architectures have become prevalent in modern CPUs.

Trusted path to such remote systems is critical in the presence of an attacker that controls the computer that the user operates. Such an attacker can observe and modify any IO data without being detected by the user or the server. We investigate the security of previous research proposals and observe several drawbacks that make them vulnerable to attacks. Based on these observations we identify novel requirements for secure IO operation in the presence of a compromised host. </p> <p></p> As a solution, we propose ProtectIOn, a system that ensures IO integrity using a trusted low-TCB device that sits between the attacker-controlled host and the IO devices. ProtectIOn intercepts the display signal and user inputs from the keyboard and mouse, and overlays secure UI on top of the HDMI frames generated by the untrusted host. The guiding design principles of ProtectIOn are that (i) integrity of user input and output cannot be considered separately, (ii) all user input modalities need to be protected simultaneously, and (iii) integrity protection should not rely on error prone user tasks like checking the presence of security indicators. By following these guidelines, ProtectIOn achieves strong protection for IO integrity. We also propose an extension of ProtectIOn for IO confidentiality and implement a plug-and-play prototype and evaluate its performance. </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="social"> <div class="contact-icons"> <a href="mailto:%79%6F%75@%65%78%61%6D%70%6C%65.%63%6F%6D" title="email"><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope"></i></a> <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1010907" title="Inspire HEP" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-inspire"></i></a> <a href="/feed.xml" title="RSS Feed"><i class="fa-solid fa-square-rss"></i></a> <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qc6CJjYAAAAJ" title="Google Scholar" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><i class="ai ai-google-scholar"></i></a> <a href="https://www.alberteinstein.com/" title="Custom Social" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> <img src="https://www.alberteinstein.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cropped-favicon-192x192.png" alt="Custom Social"> </a> </div> <div class="contact-note"></div> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2025 Aritra Dhar.
