I will attend [DAC-2024](https://www.dac.com/) in San Franciso, California, from June 23 to 27, 2024. I will present two posters: [Principles for Enabling TEEs on Domain-Specific Accelerators](https://61dac.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=RESEARCH460&sess=sess236) and [Confidential Computing with Heterogeneous Devices at Cloud-Scale](https://61dac.conference-program.com/presentation/?id=RESEARCH461&sess=sess237).
